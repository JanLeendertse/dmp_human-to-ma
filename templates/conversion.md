- Opened site https://json-csv.com/
- Uploaded [JSON file](maDMP-schema-1.0.json)
- Downloaded the result and stored it [locally](maDMP-schema-1.0.csv)
<!-- - Noticed that the result was not very useful in LibreOffice -->
- Saved [OpenOffice file](maDMP-schema-1.0.ods)
- Reduced column „I“ (properties__dmp__properties)

This does not seem to get to a usable result.


# 2020-08-18

- export files from 08-14 deleted, because they were useless

- another try with [JSON file](ex9-dmp-long.json)
- exported xlxs and csv
- result still useless


skip conversion from json to csv

rather inserting from ex9-dmp-long manually
